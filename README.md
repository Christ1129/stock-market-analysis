# VBA-challenge

In this assignment, I created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:


* The ticker symbol.


* Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


* The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.


* The total stock volume of the stock.

Screen shots of each year of the larger dataset have been provided for 2018, 2019 and 2020.
